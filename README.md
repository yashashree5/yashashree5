## About Me

I'm a data professional and former Software Engineer transitioning into the data and AI space. My background in backend engineering at **Barclays** (BA4) gives me a strong foundation in building production-grade systems — I bring that same rigor to data pipelines, ML models, and real-time analytics.

-  Pursuing **MS in Applied Data Intelligence** at San José State University
-  Previously **Software Engineer (BA4) @ Barclays** — Java microservices, high-volume SQL analytics, SOX audits
-  Currently building projects across **data engineering, ML, and full-stack AI**
-  San Jose, CA
